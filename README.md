# Project Euler Solutions

This repository contains my solutions to Project Euler problems, implemented in Python, C, and C++. 
The goal is to practice **problem-solving**, **algorithmic thinking**, and **programming skills**.

## Features
- Solutions organized by problem number (e.g., problem_001.py, problem_002.cpp)
- Multiple programming languages: Python, C, C++
- Clear code with comments and explanations
- Efficient algorithms where possible (e.g., prime factorization, largest product calculations)

## Usage
- Clone the repository
- Navigate to the problem folder
- Run the code in the corresponding language environment

## Note
- **No direct answers** are shared to respect Project Euler rules
- Focus is on **learning algorithms and coding techniques**
